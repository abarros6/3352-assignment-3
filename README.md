Assignment Requirement:

"Use the Model-View-Controller pattern to provide a skeleton implementation of your Lesson Tool system. By skeleton implementation I mean that you donâ€™t have to provide the detailed implementation of each of the classes you identified in the previous stages. Just one file per class without detailed implementation inside would be sufficient.

Please add comments to your code to demonstrate your understanding. Compress the folder of your application and submit it here as one archive."
